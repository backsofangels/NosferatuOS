# NosferatuOS

**When light fades, old machines awaken.**

NosferatuOS is a reawakening of forgotten tablets — a lightweight Android 7.1.2–based system crafted to turn dust-covered devices into devoted companions for reading.  
Forged from digital decay, it breathes life into circuits long thought dead, defying obsolescence with quiet purpose.

## Philosophy

In an age where machines are discarded in pursuit of novelty, NosferatuOS stands as an act of rebellion — a vow of conservation through restraint.

Its essence is stark and deliberate:
- **Simplicity over abundance.**  
- **Silence over background noise.**  
- **Lightness over bloat.**  
- **Longevity over waste.**

This is not another ROM seeking to do everything. NosferatuOS exists to do **one thing with purity** — to serve the reader, the seeker of words, the dreamer in the night.

## Features

- Android 7.1.2 core, optimized for forgotten hardware  
- Quiet system design: no idle chatter, no intrusive daemons  
- Minimal interface, built for immersion and calm  
- Low memory footprint for older chips and modest RAM  
- Balanced performance focused solely on reading  

## Coming in Future Nights

The project is still young — its form, like the moon, still growing.  
Future releases may bring:

- A dark-tuned interface for night reading  
- Extended battery profiles — slow heartbeat, long endurance  
- Preloaded reading essentials (light eBook reader, simple file access)  
- Native support for EPUB, PDF, and MOBI formats  
- Adaptive greyscale and eye comfort layers  
- Optional offline dictionaries and minimalist notification controls  

Every addition will be weighed carefully — growth without excess.

## For Whom the System Wakes

NosferatuOS is made for those who:
- Can revive a tablet with flashing tools and patience  
- Desire a reading sanctuary free from distraction  
- Believe that even old silicon deserves a second dawn  
- Choose sustainability over consumption  

This is not a toy, nor a convenience: it’s a ritual of restoration.

## Installation (Soon to Rise)

Instructions will soon follow as the system matures.  
The process will require basic Android flashing knowledge and a steady hand.
